# auction-marketplace
 Decentralized online auction marketplace where users can sign up, log in, and connect their wallets. Users can create auctions through the UI, which deploys an Auction smart contract. Bidders can place bids, and at auction close, the winner is selected, transferring contract ownership to them.
